<h2>Fall!!</h2>
<img src="images/fall.jpg">
	<h4>I, Jordan Andrigo, have reason to believe that Fall is much better than Spring!!</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Fall is the most beautiful season of them all, the leaves are changing and the air is fresh and crisp!</li>
		<li>As the temperatures begin to cool, we dig out our favourite hoodies for... SWEATER WEATHER!</li>
		<li>Not to mention all of the fun acitvites that fall into FALL, (pun intended) such as pumpkin carving, jumping into a pile of freshly fallen leaves, the annual fall fairs, and of course baking festive cookies with your loved ones.</li>
		<li>It's SPOOKY SEASON.</li>
		<li>We've got Halloween and Thanksgiving, which means lots of goodies to fill the belly with, just in time for winter! Gotta get some fat on them bones!</li>
		<li>Oh, and how could we forget about the famous pumpkin spice lattes from Starbucks, for all you basic white girls.</li>
	</ul>
<h2>Spring!!</h2>

	<h4>I, Tessa Cooper, believe that SPRING is far superior of a season than Fall!</h4>
		<ul>
			<li> Spring is a better season than fall because it’s the one everyone looks forward to after a long Winter! It’s the best time of the year because we’re finally out of the ‘Winter blues’!</li>
			<li> Moreover, Spring is the season that boasts the budding of the trees and plants around us. It’s so beautiful and refreshing to see the world around us slowly turn green again. Not only is the world blooming, but so is the wildlife!</li>
			<li> Spring is a time of LONG WEEKENDS! We have Easter to look forward to, as well as Victoria Day! Is there anything better than extra time spent with family?</li>
			<li> Days are getting longer! And brighter! It’s a great time to get outdoors and soak up some vitamin D</li>
			<li> School’s out!!!! Woo hoo!</li>
			<li> The birds are always chirping, baby bunnies and squirrels are running amok</li>
			<li> Spring is the greatest season because it’s when the greatest sport comes back! Baseball! Time for peanuts and crackerjacks (let’s be real, beer and hot dogs!) at the ballpark!</li>
