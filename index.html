	<h2>Fall!!</h2>

	<h4>I, Jordan Andrigo, have reason to believe that Fall is much better than Spring!!</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Fall is the most beautiful season of them all, the leaves are changing and the air is fresh and crisp!</li>
		<li>As the temperatures begin to cool, we dig out our favourite hoodies for... SWEATER WEATHER!</li>
		<li>Not to mention all of the fun acitvites that fall into FALL, (pun intended) such as pumpkin carving, jumping into a pile of freshly fallen leaves, the annual fall fairs, and of course baking festive cookies with your loved ones.</li>
		<li>It's SPOOKY SEASON.</li>
		<li>We've got Halloween and Thanksgiving, which means lots of goodies to fill the belly with, just in time for winter! Gotta get some fat on them bones!</li>
		<li>Oh, and how could we forget about the famous pumpkin spice lattes from Starbucks, for all you basic white girls.</li>
